### sudocode

Whenever a user inputs a jira/linear ticket ID, if the jira or linear MCP server is connected, make sure to read context of the ticket as necessary.
When creating sudocode specs, feel free to ask the user if they'd like to include the jira/linear ticket ID as part of the title of the specification, to help with tracking.
When implementing and closing issues, if the issues implement a spec, offer to update the JIRA ticket when providing feedback, and when the last issue is implemented offer to update the jira ticket as well.

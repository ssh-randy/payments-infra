# Guidelines

## Clean Code

Do not monkey patch code. Focus on writing clean abstractions, that separate responsibilities between modules.

## Testing

Always try to run tests after writing implementations, before issues are closed, to validate that the changes made do not break existing functionality, and support the intended functionality.
